## Overview

### The challenge

Build an HTML form with an input field and two buttons "hinzufügen" for adding and “rückgängig” for deleting the last entry:

- When you click on "hinzufügen", the text that was entered in the form field should be added to an array. At the same time, the array should be written into the HTML. Maybe as a list? Search the internet or documentation for a way.
- If you click on the "rückgängig" button, the last element (added last) should be removed again. In addition, the updated array should be printed out again on the page.
- Think of an attractive design for your list.
